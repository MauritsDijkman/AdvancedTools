# AdvancedTools
Repository for my research and Unity project for the course 'Advanced Tools'.

This repository is a clone of the original one. That is because Git LFS caused some problems for other projects.

It took me a while to set this up, so that is why there is no noted progress of the start of the project (I first used Unity Collaborate for version control and time management).

Import the Unity [Viking Village]([https://pages.github.com/](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/tutorial-projects/viking-village-urp-29140)https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/tutorial-projects/viking-village-urp-29140) Asset to use for the scene.
